## About Me

I am a first year Ph.D. student at University of Brasília (UnB) under the supervision of <a href="http://pz.mat.unb.br/">Dr. Pavel Zalesski</a>. Currently we are finishing a paper containing some results about profinite groups having abelian Sylow subgroups. 

## Research Interests

- **Group Theory:** profinite group theory, free pro-C constructions and profinite Bass-Serre theory.

## Book Recommendations

These are some good (*in my opinion*) books to construct a solid mathematical base:

- **Abstract Algebra:** Abstract Algebra - Dummit & Foot, A Course in the Theory of Groups - Robinson, Examples of Groups - Weinstein, Field and Galois Theory - Morandi.

- **Real Analysis:** Real Mathematics Analysis - Pugh, Principles of Mathematical Analysis - Rudin, Calculus on Manifolds - Spivak.

- **Linear Algebra:** Linear Algebra and Its Applications - Lax.

- **Topology:** General Topology - Willard.
