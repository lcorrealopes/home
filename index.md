## About Me

I am a first year Ph.D. student at University of Bras√≠lia (UnB) under the supervision of <a href="http://pz.mat.unb.br/">Dr. Pavel Zalesski</a>. Currently we are finishing a paper containing some results about profinite groups having abelian Sylow subgroups. 

## Research Interests

- **Group Theory:** profinite group theory, free pro-C constructions and profinite Bass-Serre theory.
