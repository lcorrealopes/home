## About Me

I am a second year Ph.D. student at University of Brasília (UnB) under the supervision of <a href="http://pz.mat.unb.br/">Dr. Pavel Zalesski</a>. Currently we are working on profinite groups acting *k*-acylindrically on profinite trees.

## Research Interests

- **Group Theory:** profinite group theory, free pro-*C* constructions and profinite Bass-Serre theory.

## Book Recommendations

These are some good (*in my opinion*) books to construct a solid mathematical base:

- **Abstract Algebra:**
  - *Abstract Algebra* (Dummit & Foot),
  - *A Course in the Theory of Groups* (Robinson),
  - *Examples of Groups* (Weinstein),
  - *Field and Galois Theory* (Morandi).

- **Real Analysis:**
  - *Real Mathematical Analysis* (Pugh),
  - *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* (Rudin),
  - *Calculus on Manifolds* (Spivak).

- **Linear Algebra:**
  - *Linear Algebra and Its Applications* (Lax).

- **Topology:**
  - *General Topology* (Willard).

If you are interested in learn what I study, I suggest you to follow the sequence:

## Mathematical Texts

- My <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/lcorrealopes/home/raw/main/assets/files/monograph.pdf">monograph</a> on solvable groups (in portuguese).
- My <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/lcorrealopes/home/raw/main/assets/files/thesis.pdf">thesis</a> on *p*-adic analytic groups (in portuguese).

**Profinite groups, free constructions and some Bass-Serre theory**

These texts are some interesting parts of my personal notes written in preparation for my PhD Algebra Exam. I will upload the archives randomly. Unfortunatelly they are only in portuguese language at the time :)

- Part I: something about profinite groups.
- Part II: <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/lcorrealopes/home/raw/main/assets/files/Free-Projective.pdf">Free vs Projective Groups</a>.
- Part III: something about free products.
- Part IV: something about amalgamated products.
- Part V: something about HNN-extensions.
- Part VI: something about Bass-Serre theory.

## Papers

- Profinite groups with abelian Sylow subgroups (join with P. Zalesskii and P. Shumyatsky): *submitted*.
- Profinite groups acting $k$-acylindrically on profinite trees (join with P. Zalesskii): *in preparation*.
